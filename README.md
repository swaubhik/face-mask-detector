## :innocent: Motivation

In the present scenario due to Covid-19, there is no efficient face mask detection applications which are now in high demand for transportation means, densely populated areas, residential districts, large-scale manufacturers and other enterprises to ensure safety. Also, the absence of large datasets of **â€˜with_maskâ€™** images has made this task more cumbersome and challenging.

## :warning: TechStack/framework used

- [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)
- [Caffe-based face detector](https://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/)
- [Keras](https://keras.io/)
- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
- [MobileNetV2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.04381)

## :star: Features

Our face mask detector didn't use any morphed masked images dataset. The model is accurate, and since we used the MobileNetV2 architecture, itâ€™s also computationally efficient and thus making it easier to deploy the model to embedded systems (Raspberry Pi, Google Coral, etc.).

This system can therefore be used in real-time applications which require face-mask detection for safety purposes due to the outbreak of Covid-19. This project can be integrated with embedded systems for application in airports, railway stations, offices, schools, and public places to ensure that public safety guidelines are followed.

## :file_folder: Dataset

The dataset used can be downloaded here - [Click to Download](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/144CEMv7po2GD1Ea8XPirTZ8-OflINcoC?usp=sharing)

This dataset consists of **4095 images** belonging to two classes:

- **with_mask: 2165 images**
- **without_mask: 1930 images**

The images used were real images of faces wearing masks. The images were collected from the following sources:

- **Bing Search API**
- **Kaggle datasets**
- **RMFD dataset** ([See here](https://github.com/X-zhangyang/Real-World-Masked-Face-Dataset/tree/master/RWMFD_part_1))

## :key: Prerequisites

All the dependencies and required libraries are included in the file <code>requirements.txt</code> [See here](https://github.com/swaubhik/face-mask-detector/blob/master/requirements.txt)

## ðŸš€&nbsp; Installation

1. Clone the repo

```
$ git clone https://github.com/swaubhik/face-mask-detector.git
```

2. Change your directory to the cloned repo and create a Python virtual environment named 'test'

```
$ mkvirtualenv test
```

3. Now, run the following command in your Terminal/Command Prompt to install the libraries required

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## :bulb: Working

1. Open terminal. Go into the cloned project directory and type the following command:

```
$ python train_mask_detector.py --dataset dataset
```

2. To detect face masks in an image type the following command:

```
$ python detect_mask_image.py --image images/pic1.jpeg
```

3. To detect face masks in real-time video streams type the following command:

```
$ python detect_mask_video.py
```

## :key: Results

#### Our model gave 93% accuracy for Face Mask Detection after training via <code>tensorflow-gpu==2.0.0</code>
